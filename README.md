[Openscad](https://www.openscad.org/) model (and 2D blueprints, to come...)

Important files :
* parameters : all the dimensions/positions we want to define only once, and all the rest is based on that
* standardParts : the model of the parts we buy on the market
* customParts : all the parts we build specifically for this project, laser cut inox, aluminium profiles, and very few 3D printed parts.
* assembly : all previous parts assembled together to view the subassemblies and final model

* cncDrill, drilling : the tools to drill the profiles
* views : exploded views, mainly to make the assembly manual
* functions, timing_belts, : various helpers
